This is my copy of the "Ultimate Portfolio Project" tutorial series in Hacking with Swift+. I mostly dabbled with Swift and iOS dev in the past, but decided it's time to start improving these skills too. 

## What have I learned in this series?

* Accessibility (VoiceOver, Internationalization & Strings files)
* Core Data Basics
* Providing sample data for canvas previews.
* Memory only cloud kit container stores, for testing.
* Various Xcode tips and tricks
* SwiftLint

## Prerequisites
* iOS 14.2 / Xcode 12.3 / Swift 5.3
* Some features, like testing VoiceOver, require a physical device instead of the simulator.
* If SwiftLint is installed, it will be used to generate linter warnings when building the app.
